# Do Another Round Of Fine Tuning With Minor Changes To Prompt

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/build_llm_karpathy`

## Contents

One more round of fine-tuning for v3 might help to improve responses even more. I improved my rubric @prompts.py. I can use this with another fine-tune run to hopefully improve the response capabilities of the model.

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- DONE -->
