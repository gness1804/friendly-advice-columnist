# Add The Ability To Ask The Model Follow Up Questions

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/build_llm_karpathy`

## Contents

Right now, the user can ask the application a question, and the application will spit out an answer. But I don't think the application is capable of holding an extended conversation. I want to add the ability for the user to ask follow-up questions. This will require the application to know the context. We will need some way of preserving context and for the application to have a concept of different conversations that have different contexts.

## Acceptance criteria
